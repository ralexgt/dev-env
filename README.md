# Development Environment Setup

This repository contains the necessary scripts to give me a good start with tmux,
nvim and some other tools I find useful.

Everything here is personal preferences and will most probably be changed or added
upon in the future. 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. cd to the local repo
3. ./run && ./dev-env 
4. You should be good to go with nvim and tmux in a good starting point

Check that every script has right permissions.

## Personal
I use Mason for Neovim lsps and any terminal is going to do get the job done.
