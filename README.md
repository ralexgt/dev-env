# Development Environment Setup

This repository contains the necessary scripts to give me a good start with tmux,
nvim and some other tools I find useful.

Everything here is personal preference and will most probably be changed or added
upon in the future. 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. cd to the local repo
3. execute ./run and ./dev-env 
4. You should be ready to go with Neovim and tmux

! I useason for Neovim lsps and any terminal is going to get the job done.
! Check that every script has right the permissions.
